In this repo I'll collect various proofs (no limit on size in either direction) that I come up with during my studies. These will mainly be sourced from independent studies and contain proofs for statements that are left as "exercises to the reader". I'm collecting these together in one repo for my own sake and am open sourcing them for the benefit of others.

Please feel free to open a PR in order to point out any issues with my proofs.
